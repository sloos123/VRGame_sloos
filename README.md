### Data:

Development Platforms: Mac Os Mojave Version 10.14.6 / Unity Version 2019.1.14f1 / XCode
Target Platform: iOs version 12.4.2

### Concept/Idea:

Inktober prompt list: Dark, Dragon

I will create a dark VR room. In this room you can move freely. There will be laying random objects all over the place. In the middle of the room there are 3 poles. Behind the poles you can see a picture of a dragon wearing a crown, a neckless and a ring. This 3 objects you have to find in the room. After you find the objects you have to grab them and lay them onto each pole. If it's the correct object it will make a sound. The whole room will look asian and have a background music. Next to the dragon picture there will also be two globes that turn and are rotated.
